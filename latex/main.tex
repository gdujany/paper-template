% You can include short sections directly in the main tex file.
% However, for larger papers it is desirable to split the text into
% several semiautonomous files, which can be revised independently.
% This is especially useful when developing a document in
% collaboration with several people, since then different parts can be
% edited independently.  This type of file organization is shown here.

The author list for journal publications is generated from the Membership Database shortly after 'approval to go to paper' has been given.
It will be sent to you by email shortly after a paper number has been assigned.
The author list should be included already at first circulation,
to allow new members of the collaboration to verify that they have been included correctly.
Occasionally a misspelled name is corrected, or associated institutions become full members.
Therefore an updated author list will be sent to you after the final EB review of the paper.
In case line numbering doesn't work well after including the authorlist, try moving the \verb!\bigskip! after the last author to a separate line.


The authorship for Conference Reports should be ``The LHCb collaboration'', with a footnote giving the name(s) of the contact
  author(s), but without the full list of collaboration names.
